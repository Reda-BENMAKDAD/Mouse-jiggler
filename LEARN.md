# Mouse jiggler LEARN.md

I’m going to detail you how I built this little fun program

1. __Idea__:
I got the idea to create this Mouse-jiggler because I saw people using ***MECHANICAL*** (yes really) mouse-jigglers (that moved your mouse physically) and I thought that it was overkill and I could do it programmatically so I wanted to make my own. And also I saw software mouse-jigglers and I wondered how they were made so my "creative" side pushed me to code my own. That’s it. So guys first lesson, always let your creative side take over, you’ll learn a lot.

2. __Coding__:
Ok so when I started coding I said to myself, __"it's going to be really easy, matter of not even an hour"__, and as programmers, you know guys that it's never like that. It ended-up taking me like a whole day, but I learned a lot about threads and how they work and it was really fun. Aside from that I don't have too much to say.

3. __Overall__: It may look like a simple thing, but you learn a lot from this little projects. Anyway if you want to add some feature or something feel free to create pull-requests guys.

### Bye!
